I got to looking at World Heritage Sites the other day. I have to admit a certain amount of American/Texan arrogance when I saw that the tiny county of Laos had three sites. How could such a tiny little country have so many sites? I thought to myself.

Well, even though Laos is about the size of a thumbtack on the world map hanging on my wall, it does give us a rather interesting World Heritage Site in the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_of_Jars][Plain of Jars.]] If I understand the story there is a huge field over in Laos that has a bajillion jars, like the one pictured above, all over the place. The eggheads have decided that these jars are where ancient folk buried their dead.
           
Of course, I rather like the alternative explanation provided by legend of a race of giants occupying what we know of as Laos and these huge stone pots were for the making "huge amounts" of /"lau hai"/ or rice wine.

Now there is what is missing from the world- a race of giants getting smashed on homebrew!
